# Nonlinear Optical Simulation

This repository holds a program written in Python 3.8.5 that simulations mixing 
two laser pulses in a nonlinear crystal to produce a third laser pulse of a 
different frequency.

## Files contained

main.py : Run the simulation from this file. It should produce a graph.
Sim_Initialisation.py : This contains classes to intialisation the simulation and the pulses
Crystal_module.py : Contains crystal information and functions
